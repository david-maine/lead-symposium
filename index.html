        <div class="about-content">Machine learning and decision making,
            considered essential parts in artificial intelligence,
            play an increasingly important role in providing solutions to
            complex problems in a broad range of domains.This includes
            but is not limited to image recognition, self-driving
            cars, virtual personal assistants,games and adaptive natural
            resource management.Recently, the field has made significant advances
            through an interplay of theory, algorithms and applications.
            For example, mathematical and statistical theories play a multi-faceted
            role: powering the design, analysis and improvement of algorithms;
            providing insights on when and why algorithms work; constructing
            guidelines on how to effectively apply algorithms in applications
            from different disciplines. In addition, the emergence of challenging
            applications stimulates the development of more powerful algorithms and new
            theories.This symposium calls for the participation of PhD students working
            on the theory, algorithms and applications in the field of machine learning and
            decision making. It aims to bring together students from all related disciplines
            to present their research to a wide audience, as well as to connect, interact,
            and exchange ideas with other students. The symposium will include a series of
            invited talks, tutorials,student contributed talks, and a number of events to
            encourage discussion and collaboration between students.
